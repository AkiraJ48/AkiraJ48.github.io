## [](#header-2) Git
Undertook the git branching exercise game.  
URL: [http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/](another-place)  

In the beginning I felt it was quite useful, but at the later stages,
I felt that as opposed to using my knowledge of the git commands, I was just visually attempting to solve the problems.

Sol also gave me a quick session on dealing with git conflicts using vi, which I found very useful.
