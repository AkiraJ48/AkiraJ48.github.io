## [](#header-2) Workshops
TDD Workshop:

Pair Programming Workshop:

## [](#header-2) Testing Environments
Set up and familiarized myself with jUnit in IntelliJ. In addition, set up Jest for Javascript
testing.

## [](#header-2) Setting up AWS
Created an AWS EC2 instance.

## [](#header-2) Git
Undertook the git branching exercise game. In the beginning I felt it was quite useful,
but at the later stages, I felt that as opposed to using my knowledge of the git commands,
I was just visually attempting to solve the problems.

Sol also gave me a quick session on dealing with git conflicts, which was very
useful.
