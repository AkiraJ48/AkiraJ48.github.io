## [](#header-2) Code Retreat
1. <strong>Problem:</strong> String Kata Challenge (From Week 1)   
2. <strong>Process:</strong> Involved 30 minute iterations, where we would pair up
with a new person each time. Within that 30 minutes, we were tasked with attempting
to solve the problem, given the constraints. In each iteration, more constraints would
be applied.   
3. <strong>Constraints:</strong>  
    -> Methods can only have up to 4 lines of code.   
    -> No using mouse/trackpad.    
    -> No Regex.
4. <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Personally, I really enjoyed the process of attempting
to solve the given problem with constraints. I felt it added to the complexity of the
problem. In addition, I learnt different ways of approaching the problem from
my peers which was very beneficial. The only criticism I have is that several other proteges and I had previously
completed the same problem, so when introduced to the problem, we weren't able to
necessarily come in with a fresh mind (i.e. we already had preconceived notions on
how to solve the problem).
