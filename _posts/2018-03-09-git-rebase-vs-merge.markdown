# [](#header-1)Git: Rebase vs Merge (Pending until we do the git advanced workshop)
> One of the most important skills of a Git user lies in their ability to maintain a clean, semantic public history of commits.

***Is our new branch just a temporary, local branch?***


***Is it a "well-known" branch***
Well-known in the sense of, it's a clearly identified branch that serves
a specific purpose, as set by a team or an individual. The branch may represent a
sprint, story or an issue/ticket. Therefore it's clearly desirable for the history
of this branch to remain visible in the history of the master branch.
As a result, we will use merge.

Merge involves moving the current branch ahead, so that it incorporates the work
of another branch.
