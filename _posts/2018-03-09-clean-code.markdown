## [](#header-2) Chapter 1

> Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements.
We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We may create tools that help us
parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures.
But we will never eliminate necessary precision—so there will always be code. (Page 33)

***The Total Cost of Owning a Mess***
> Every change they make to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code. No change is trivial.
As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero.

***The Grand Redesign in the Sky***
> Because the old design is horrendous, people want to re-create it.

***Attitude***
> We are unprofessional.
The managers and marketers look to us for the information they need to make promises and commitments;
and even when they don’t look to us, we should not be shy about telling them what we think.
So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.

***The Primal Conundrum***
> The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

***The Art of Clean Code?***
> Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied through a painstakingly acquired sense of “cleanliness.”

***What is Clean Code?***
> Clean code should be pleasing to read.  
> Bad code tempts the mess to grow!   
> Error handing should be complete.   
> Clean code is focused.   
> Our code should be matter-of-fact as opposed to speculative. It should contain only what is necessary.   
> Clean code makes it easy for other people to enhance it.   
> Smaller is better.   

***Schools of Thought***

***We are Authors***
> We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.
