## [](#header-1)Highlights
The most memorable activity that occurred during orientation week at MYOB
was most definitely the REACH workshop. Not only was the experience extremely
enjoyable, it allowed the graduates to get to know each other a lot better.

Another great activity involved being exposed to the client facing side of
the company. Having the opportunity to witness how our employees supported
existing clients and obtained new clients was very beneficial.
